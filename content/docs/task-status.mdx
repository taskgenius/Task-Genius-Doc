import { VersionCallout } from "@/components/VersionCallout";

Task Status allows you to go beyond Obsidian's basic "incomplete" (`- [ ]`) and "complete" (`- [x]`) checkboxes. Define custom task states like "In Progress", "Waiting", or "Abandoned" to match your workflow, then cycle through them with a single click.

<VersionCallout version="5.0.0" />

## Why Use Custom Task Statuses?

### The Problem with Basic Checkboxes

Obsidian's default tasks only support two states:
- `- [ ]` Incomplete
- `- [x]` Complete

But real-world tasks often have more nuanced states:
- Tasks you're actively working on (in progress)
- Tasks waiting for someone else (blocked)
- Tasks you've decided not to do (abandoned)
- Tasks you're planning to do later (scheduled)

### The Solution

Task Genius lets you define **custom status markers** and organize them into a **status cycle** that matches your workflow.

**Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Buy groceries          ← Not started
- [/] Write report           ← In progress
- [?] Review proposal        ← Waiting/Planned
- [-] Cancelled meeting      ← Abandoned
- [x] Submit invoice         ← Completed
```

## Common Use Cases

### GTD (Getting Things Done) Workflow

**Status Cycle:** Inbox → Next Action → Waiting → Done

```markdown
- [ ] Process emails         ← Inbox
- [>] Call client           ← Next Action
- [?] Waiting for approval  ← Waiting
- [x] Send proposal         ← Done
```

### Agile/Scrum Development

**Status Cycle:** Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done

```markdown
- [ ] Add login feature     ← Backlog
- [/] Implement API         ← In Progress
- [r] Code review pending   ← Review
- [x] Deploy to staging     ← Done
```

### Simple Three-State Workflow (Recommended for Beginners)

**Status Cycle:** To Do → Doing → Done

```markdown
- [ ] Read documentation    ← To Do
- [/] Write code           ← Doing
- [x] Submit PR            ← Done
```

## Quick Start

<DeepLinkButton href="obsidian://task-genius/settings?tab=task-status">
  Open Task Status Settings
</DeepLinkButton>
<DeepLinkFallback />

### For New Users: Add "In Progress" Status

The simplest enhancement is adding a single "In Progress" state:

1. Open **Task Status Settings**
2. Go to **"Task Status Switcher"** section
3. Click **"Add status"**
4. Configure the new status:
   - **Status name:** `In Progress`
   - **Mark:** `/` (forward slash)
   - **Include in cycle:** ✅ Enabled
5. **Save settings**

Now you can cycle through: `[ ]` → `[/]` → `[x]`

### For Advanced Users: Create Custom Workflow

Create a full custom status cycle:

1. Open **Task Status Settings**
2. In **"Task Status Switcher"**, add multiple statuses:
   - `Not Started` → Mark: ` ` (space)
   - `In Progress` → Mark: `/`
   - `Review` → Mark: `r`
   - `Waiting` → Mark: `?`
   - `Done` → Mark: `x`
3. Use **up/down arrows** to reorder the cycle
4. **Enable "Enable task status switcher"** toggle
5. **Save settings**

## Cycling Through Statuses

### Click to Cycle

Once configured, click the checkbox to cycle through your defined statuses:

**Example Cycle:**
```
Click 1: - [ ] Task  →  - [/] Task  (In Progress)
Click 2: - [/] Task  →  - [x] Task  (Done)
Click 3: - [x] Task  →  - [ ] Task  (Back to start)
```

**Where You Can Click:**
- **In Editor (Live Preview):** Click the checkbox or custom mark
- **In Task Genius View:** Click the task marker in the task list
- **In Source Mode:** Click the text mark (if "Enable text mark in source mode" is enabled)

### Keyboard Commands

Use commands for precise control:

- **`Task Genius: Cycle task status forward`**: Move to the next status in your cycle
- **`Task Genius: Cycle task status backward`**: Move to the previous status

**Tip:** Assign hotkeys to these commands in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings for faster status changes.

## Defining Status Categories

Task Genius needs to understand what each status marker **means** for progress tracking and automation.

### Status Categories

Configure these in **"Task Status Settings"** → **"Defining Status Markers"**:

#### 1. **Not Started** (Default: ` ` space)

Tasks that haven't been started yet.

```markdown
- [ ] Plan project
- [ ] Schedule meeting
```

**Behavior:**
- Counted as incomplete in progress bars
- Default starting state for new tasks

---

#### 2. **In Progress** (Default: `/`)

Tasks actively being worked on.

```markdown
- [/] Writing documentation
- [>] Debugging feature
```

**Behavior:**
- Counted as incomplete but "active" in progress bars
- Can trigger parent task automation (see below)
- Can work with [Append Date](/docs/append-date) to auto-add start dates

**Multiple Markers:** Use `|` to define alternatives: `/|>` (both `/` and `>` mean "in progress")

---

#### 3. **Planned** (Default: `?`)

Tasks scheduled or waiting for action from others.

```markdown
- [?] Waiting for client feedback
- [?] Scheduled for next week
```

**Behavior:**
- Counted as incomplete by default
- Often excluded from progress tracking (see [Task Counting](#task-counting) below)

---

#### 4. **Abandoned** (Default: `-`)

Tasks that won't be completed (cancelled, not relevant, etc.).

```markdown
- [-] Cancelled meeting
- [-] Obsolete task
```

**Behavior:**
- Counted as "not completed" but removed from active tracking
- Often excluded from progress bars

---

#### 5. **Completed** (Default: `x`)

Finished tasks.

```markdown
- [x] Submitted report
- [X] Deployed feature  ← Capital X also works
```

**Behavior:**
- Counted as complete in progress bars
- Can auto-set completion date
- Visually distinct (strikethrough) in most themes

**Multiple Markers:** Use `x|X` to accept both lowercase and uppercase

---

### Handling Other Statuses

If you use a marker not defined in the categories above (e.g., `[!]`, `[r]`), configure how Task Genius should interpret it:

**Setting:** "Count other statuses as"

**Options:**
- `not started`
- `in progress`
- `planned`
- `abandoned`
- `completed`

**Example:** If you use `[!]` for urgent tasks, set "Count other statuses as" to `in progress`.

## Task Counting & Progress Bars

Control which tasks contribute to progress calculations.

### Exclude Specific Markers

Prevent certain statuses from being counted in progress totals.

**Setting:** "Exclude specific task markers"

**Format:** Separate markers with `|`

**Example:** `?|-` (exclude planned and abandoned tasks)

**Use Case:**
```markdown
- [ ] Write code          ← Counted (0/3 complete)
- [/] Review PR          ← Counted (0/3 complete)
- [?] Wait for approval  ← NOT counted (excluded)
- [-] Cancelled task     ← NOT counted (excluded)
- [x] Deploy            ← Counted (1/3 complete)
```

Progress: **1/3** (33%)

---

### Only Count Specific Markers

Whitelist which statuses should be counted, ignoring all others.

**Setting:** "Only count specific task markers"

**Format:** Enable toggle, then specify markers with `|`

**Example:** ` |/|x` (only count not started, in progress, and completed)

**Use Case:** Strict progress tracking, ignoring all intermediate states like "planned" or "waiting".

---

Read more about progress bars in the [Progress Bars](/docs/progress-bars) documentation.

## Parent Task Automation

Automatically update parent tasks based on their subtasks.

### Auto-Complete Parent Tasks

**Setting:** "Auto complete parent task"

When **all** subtasks are completed, the parent task is automatically marked as complete.

**Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Project Launch
  - [x] Design mockups
  - [x] Develop feature
  - [x] Write tests
```

After completing the last subtask, the parent automatically becomes:
```markdown
- [x] Project Launch  ← Auto-completed
  - [x] Design mockups
  - [x] Develop feature
  - [x] Write tests
```

**Benefits:**
- Visual feedback of project completion
- Accurate progress tracking
- Reduced manual status updates

---

### Mark Parent as "In Progress"

**Setting:** "Mark parent as 'in progress' when partially complete"

When **some** (but not all) subtasks are completed, the parent task is automatically marked with your "in progress" marker.

**Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Project Launch
  - [x] Design mockups      ← Completed
  - [ ] Develop feature     ← Not started
  - [ ] Write tests         ← Not started
```

After completing one subtask, the parent automatically becomes:
```markdown
- [/] Project Launch  ← Auto-marked as "in progress"
  - [x] Design mockups
  - [ ] Develop feature
  - [ ] Write tests
```

**Benefits:**
- Visual indicator of active projects
- Easy identification of work-in-progress
- Integrates with [Append Date](/docs/append-date) to auto-add start dates

**Note:** This requires "Auto complete parent task" to be enabled.

---

### Integration with Append Date

When parent tasks are marked "in progress", they can automatically receive a **start date** if you've configured the [Append Date](/docs/append-date) feature.

**Example Workflow:**
1. Parent task starts as `- [ ] Project Launch`
2. You complete the first subtask
3. Parent becomes `- [/] Project Launch ⏳ 2025-01-15` (start date auto-added)
4. Complete all subtasks
5. Parent becomes `- [x] Project Launch ⏳ 2025-01-15 ✅ 2025-01-20` (completion date auto-added)

This provides a complete timeline of your project's lifecycle.

## Visual Customization

### Custom Task Marks

**Setting:** "Enable custom task marks"

Replace standard checkboxes with **styled text marks** based on your status cycle.

**Visual Effect:**

**Disabled (Default):**
```
☐ Not started
☐ In progress (still shows checkbox)
☑ Done
```

**Enabled:**
```
[ ] Not started
[/] In progress     ← Custom styled mark
[x] Done
```

The marks are styled with CSS classes, allowing themes to customize their appearance.

**Performance:** No impact on performance.

---

### Text Marks in Source Mode

**Setting:** "Enable text mark in source mode"

Allow clicking the text mark in **Source Mode** to cycle status.

**Disabled:** Must click the actual checkbox area
**Enabled:** Click anywhere on `[/]` to cycle

**Use Case:** Useful if you frequently work in Source Mode and want faster status cycling.

---

### Cycle Complete Status

**Setting:** "Enable cycle complete status"

Determine if clicking cycles through **all** defined states or stops at "complete".

**Enabled (Recommended):** Clicking cycles through all states in your defined cycle (including completed)
**Disabled:** Clicking stops at the completed state and won't cycle further

**Example (Enabled):**
```
[ ] → [/] → [x] → [ ] → [/] → [x] → ...
```

**Example (Disabled):**
```
[ ] → [/] → [x] (stops here, must manually edit to revert)
```

## Status Cycle Configuration

### Creating Your Cycle

**Location:** Settings → Task Status Settings → "Task Status Switcher"

1. **Enable the switcher:** Toggle "Enable task status switcher"
2. **Add statuses:** Click "Add status" for each state in your workflow
3. **Configure each status:**
   - **Status name:** Human-readable name (e.g., "In Progress")
   - **Mark:** Single character marker (e.g., `/`)
   - **Include in cycle:** Whether clicking should cycle through this status
4. **Reorder:** Use up/down arrows to set the cycling sequence
5. **Remove:** Use trash icon to delete unwanted statuses

### Include in Cycle

The **"Include in cycle"** toggle controls whether a status appears when clicking to cycle.

**Use Case:** Define statuses you want to set manually (via commands or context menu) but don't want in the click cycle.

**Example:**
```markdown
Cycle (clicking):  [ ] → [/] → [x] → [ ] ...
Manual only:       [?] Waiting (set via command, not in click cycle)
```

This keeps your click cycle simple while still supporting advanced statuses.

## Applying Status Themes

**Setting:** Task Status Settings → "Apply theme"

Quickly adopt predefined status configurations.

**Available Themes:**
- **Standard:** Basic Obsidian-style statuses
- **Things3:** Inspired by the Things 3 app
- (More themes may be available in your version)

**Warning:** Applying a theme will **override** both your:
- Custom status category definitions
- Custom status cycle configuration

**Recommendation:** Configure your own statuses manually for full control.

## Best Practices

### For Beginners: Keep It Simple

**Recommended Setup:**
- **States:** Not Started → In Progress → Done
- **Markers:** ` ` (space) → `/` → `x`
- **Parent automation:** Enable "Auto complete parent task"

This provides a significant upgrade over basic checkboxes without overwhelming complexity.

---

### For Advanced Users: Optimize for Your Workflow

**GTD Users:**
- Add "Waiting" (`?`) for tasks dependent on others
- Add "Someday" (`~`) for future considerations
- Exclude `?|~` from progress tracking

**Agile/Scrum Teams:**
- Add "Review" (`r`) for code review or QA
- Add "Blocked" (`!`) for tasks with dependencies
- Use parent automation for sprint tracking

**Project Managers:**
- Add "On Hold" (`h`) for paused work
- Add "Cancelled" (`-`) for scope changes
- Enable all parent task automation for accurate reporting

---

### Standardize Across Your Vault

**Consistency Tip:** Define your status cycle once and stick to it across all notes.

**Why:**
- Reliable progress tracking
- Easier filtering in Task Genius View
- Better compatibility with templates and automation

---

### Combine with View Modes

Use custom statuses with [View Modes](/docs/view-modes):

- **Kanban View:** Visualize tasks grouped by status
- **List View:** Filter by specific status markers
- **Calendar View:** See when tasks enter different states

---

### Use Context Menu for Rare Statuses

For statuses you rarely use:
- **Don't** include them in the cycle
- **Do** set them via right-click context menu or commands

This keeps your click cycle fast and predictable.

## Troubleshooting

### Status Not Cycling

**Issue:** Clicking the checkbox doesn't change status.

**Solution:**
- Verify "Enable task status switcher" is toggled ON
- Check that the status has "Include in cycle" enabled
- Ensure you're clicking the correct area (checkbox or mark)
- Try using the command `Task Genius: Cycle task status forward` instead

---

### Parent Task Not Auto-Completing

**Issue:** Completing all subtasks doesn't complete the parent.

**Solution:**
- Verify "Auto complete parent task" is enabled in settings
- Ensure all subtasks are using your defined "completed" marker (default `x`)
- Check that subtasks are properly indented under the parent
- Refresh the task index: `Task Genius: Refresh task index`

---

### Custom Marks Not Showing

**Issue:** Tasks still show standard checkboxes instead of custom marks.

**Solution:**
- Verify "Enable custom task marks" is toggled ON
- Check that your theme supports custom task styling
- Switch between Live Preview and Reading Mode to refresh
- Restart Obsidian if styling doesn't apply

---

### Progress Bars Counting Wrong Tasks

**Issue:** Progress percentages include tasks you want to exclude.

**Solution:**
- Review "Exclude specific task markers" setting
- Ensure markers are separated by `|` (e.g., `?|-`)
- Check "Count other statuses as" setting
- Use "Only count specific task markers" for stricter control

---

### Cycle Skipping Statuses

**Issue:** Clicking skips over some statuses in your cycle.

**Solution:**
- Verify all desired statuses have "Include in cycle" enabled
- Check the order of statuses (use up/down arrows to reorder)
- Ensure each status has a unique marker character
- Reload settings or restart Obsidian
