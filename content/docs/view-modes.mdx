View Modes provide different ways to visualize and interact with your tasks. While the left sidebar lets you choose **what tasks to see** (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Flagged), the View Mode selector at the top lets you choose **how to see them**.

<VersionCallout version="9.9.0" />

## Overview

Task Genius offers four distinct View Modes, each optimized for different workflows:

- **<ListIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> List View**: Traditional flat list display
- **<ColumnsIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> Kanban View**: Visual board with status-based columns
- **<GitBranchIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> Tree View**: Hierarchical task display
- **<CalendarIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> Calendar View**: Time-based calendar layout

**Key Benefits:**
- View the same tasks in different ways without changing filters
- Each view (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Flagged) remembers its preferred View Mode
- Switch perspectives instantly to match your current workflow
- All View Modes are workspace-specific (see [Workspace](/docs/workspace))

## Switching View Modes

### Quick Switch

1. Open any task view (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, or Flagged).
2. Look for the **View Mode selector** at the top of the main panel.
3. Click one of the four horizontal icon buttons:
   - <ListIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> for List View
   - <ColumnsIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> for Kanban View
   - <GitBranchIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> for Tree View
   - <CalendarIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> for Calendar View
4. The view updates immediately to reflect your selection.

### Persistence

- Each view (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Flagged) **independently saves** its View Mode.
- For example, you can have Inbox in List View and Today in Calendar View simultaneously.
- Your View Mode preference is saved per [Workspace](/docs/workspace).
- When you return to a view, it automatically displays in your last selected View Mode.

## Use Cases by View Mode

### Daily Planning Workflow

1. **Morning**: Use **Calendar View** on the **Today** view to see time-based tasks
2. **Midday**: Switch to **List View** to check off completed tasks and see all details
3. **Evening**: Use **Kanban View** on **Upcoming** to organize tomorrow's priorities

### Project Management

1. **Planning**: Use **Tree View** on **Inbox** to structure project tasks with subtasks
2. **Execution**: Switch to **Kanban View** to track progress through status columns
3. **Review**: Use **Calendar View** on **Upcoming** to check deadlines

### Weekly Review

1. **Review Completed**: **List View** on **Flagged** to see all important tasks
2. **Plan Ahead**: **Calendar View** on **Upcoming** to visualize the week
3. **Organize**: **Kanban View** on **Inbox** to triage new tasks

## Best Practices

### 1. Match View Mode to Task Type

- **Dated tasks**: Calendar View for time awareness
- **Status-driven work**: Kanban View for workflow clarity
- **Complex projects**: Tree View for structure
- **General processing**: List View for simplicity

### 2. Consistent View Mode per Data Source

Establish consistent View Mode defaults for each data source:
- **Inbox**: List View (for quick triage)
- **Today**: Calendar View (for time-based planning)
- **Upcoming**: Kanban View (for status tracking)
- **Flagged**: Tree View (for project focus)

### 3. Leverage Workspace-Specific Settings

Create different [Workspaces](/docs/workspace) with optimized View Mode configurations:
- **Work Workspace**: Kanban-heavy for sprint tracking
- **Personal Workspace**: Calendar-focused for scheduling
- **Project Workspace**: Tree View for hierarchical planning

### 4. Use View Mode Switching for Context

Quickly switch View Modes to answer different questions:
- "What's due soon?" → Calendar View
- "What's in progress?" → Kanban View
- "What are the project components?" → Tree View
- "What needs attention?" → List View

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks Not Showing in Calendar View

**Issue**: Some tasks are missing from Calendar View.

**Solution**:
- Verify tasks have at least one date field (Due, Scheduled, or Start Date)
- Tasks without any dates will not appear in Calendar View
- Switch to List View or Kanban View to see all tasks

### Tree View Not Available

**Issue**: Tree View button is disabled or not showing expected hierarchy.

**Solution**:
- Tree View is only available when List View is applicable
- Ensure your tasks have parent-child relationships defined
- Check if you're currently in Kanban or Calendar mode (Tree View replaces List View)

### Kanban Columns Not Matching Expectations

**Issue**: Tasks appear in unexpected columns.

**Solution**:
- Verify task status values match your status configuration
- Check [Task Status](/docs/task-status) settings
- Review active filters that might be hiding certain columns

### View Mode Not Persisting

**Issue**: View Mode resets when switching between views.

**Solution**:
- Each view (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Flagged) saves its own View Mode independently
- Ensure you're in the correct [Workspace](/docs/workspace)
- Check if settings are saving properly (Obsidian write permissions)
