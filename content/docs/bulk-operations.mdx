Bulk Operations allow you to perform actions on multiple tasks simultaneously, dramatically improving efficiency when managing large numbers of tasks. Select multiple tasks and execute common operations like status changes, date adjustments, priority updates, and more.

<VersionCallout version="9.9.0" />

## Overview

Instead of editing tasks one by one, Bulk Operations enable you to:

- **Select multiple tasks** using Shift + Click
- **Modify task properties** for all selected tasks at once
- **Execute operations** via right-click context menu
- **Save time** when managing similar tasks

**Key Benefits:**
- Efficient batch processing of tasks
- Consistent updates across multiple tasks
- Reduced repetitive work
- Powerful project management workflows

## Selecting Tasks

### How to Select Multiple Tasks

1. **Hold the Shift key** on your keyboard
2. **Click on tasks** one by one to add them to your selection
3. Each selected task will display visual feedback (see below)
4. Continue Shift + Clicking to add more tasks

**Important Notes:**
- You must **hold Shift** while clicking each task
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click** is not supported
- **Ctrl/Cmd + A** (Select All) is not supported
- There is **no maximum limit** on the number of tasks you can select

### Visual Feedback

When tasks are selected, they display:

- **Left border**: A colored border appears on the left edge of the task
- **Background color change**: The task background changes to indicate selection
- **No toolbar**: Unlike single-selection, multi-selection does not show a toolbar
- **Selection count**: The right-click menu shows the number of selected tasks

**Example:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▌ ☐ Review quarterly report       │ ← Selected (border + background)
│ ▌ ☐ Update project documentation  │ ← Selected (border + background)
│   ☐ Schedule team meeting          │ ← Not selected
│ ▌ ☐ Submit budget proposal         │ ← Selected (border + background)
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Deselecting Tasks

You can clear your selection using any of these methods:

1. **Press the `Escape` key** to clear all selections
2. **Right-click** and choose **"Clear selection"** from the menu
3. **Click outside the task list** (in empty space)
4. **Execute a bulk operation** (selection auto-clears after operation)

## View Mode Support

3. Right-click → **Bulk set priority** → **!!! Priority 3**
4. Select tasks without due dates
5. Right-click → **Bulk set date** → **Set specific date** → **Due date** → (End of week)

## Best Practices

### 1. Use List View for Bulk Operations

While Tree View is supported, **List View** provides a clearer, flatter structure for selecting multiple tasks. Switch to List View before performing bulk operations for better visibility.

### 2. Double-Check Selection Before Deleting

Always verify your selection count before executing **Bulk delete**:
- Check the menu header: "X tasks selected"
- Review the confirmation modal carefully
- Use **Clear selection** (or `Esc`) if you selected wrong tasks

### 3. Use Postpone for Relative Date Changes

When rescheduling, prefer **Postpone by...** over **Set specific date** if tasks should maintain their relative timing:
- **Set specific date**: All tasks get the same date (e.g., all due on Jan 15)
- **Postpone by**: Each task's date shifts by the same amount (e.g., all shift 3 days later)

### 4. Batch Similar Tasks Together

Group similar operations to minimize selection effort:
- Instead of selecting all tasks at once, do operations in batches:
  1. Select and update status for Group A
  2. Select and set priority for Group B
  3. Select and move to project for Group C

### 5. Leverage Project-Based Selection

Use project or tag filters to narrow visible tasks before bulk selecting:
1. Apply filter to show only relevant tasks
2. Select all visible tasks (easier than manual selection in large lists)
3. Execute bulk operation
4. Clear filter

### 6. Test with Small Batches First

When using a bulk operation for the first time:
1. Select 2-3 tasks as a test
2. Execute the operation
3. Verify the results
4. Proceed with larger batches once confident

### 7. Combine with View Modes

Use the right [View Mode](/docs/view-modes) for context, then switch to List View for bulk operations:
- **Plan in Calendar View** → Switch to **List View** for bulk date changes
- **Track in Kanban View** → Switch to **List View** for bulk status changes
- **Organize in Tree View** → Use **Tree View** directly for hierarchical bulk operations

## Limitations

### View Mode Restrictions

- **Not supported in Kanban View**: Multi-selection is unavailable
- **Not supported in Calendar View**: Multi-selection is unavailable
- **Only List and Tree View**: Must be in these View Modes to use bulk operations

**Workaround:** Temporarily switch to List View to perform bulk operations, then switch back to your preferred View Mode.

### No Select All

- **No Ctrl/Cmd + A**: Cannot select all visible tasks with a keyboard shortcut
- **No "Select All" button**: Must manually Shift + Click each task

**Workaround:** Use filters to reduce the visible task count, then Shift + Click the remaining tasks.

### No Ctrl/Cmd + Click for Toggle Selection

- **Cannot toggle individual tasks**: No way to add/remove single tasks from selection without Shift
- **Cannot deselect one task**: Must clear all and re-select

**Workaround:** Be careful with initial selection. Use **Clear selection** if you make a mistake, then re-select.

### Selection Clears After Operation

- **No persistent selection**: After executing a bulk operation, selection is automatically cleared
- **Cannot chain operations**: Must re-select tasks for each operation

**Workaround:** Plan to execute only one operation per selection, or use filters to maintain the same visible task set for re-selection.

### No Undo for Bulk Operations

- **Operations are immediate**: Changes are written to files immediately
- **No built-in undo**: Must manually revert changes

**Workaround:**
- Use version control (Git) for your vault to enable rollback
- Test with small batches before large operations
- Keep backups of your vault

### No Progress Indicator for Large Batches

- **No loading bar**: Large bulk operations may appear to "hang"
- **No cancellation**: Cannot abort an in-progress operation

**Workaround:**
- Be patient with large selections (100+ tasks)
- Check the console for progress logs if needed
- Avoid selecting thousands of tasks in a single batch

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks Not Selecting

**Issue:** Clicking tasks while holding Shift doesn't select them.

**Solution:**
- Verify you're in **List View** or **Tree View** (not Kanban or Calendar)
- Ensure you're **holding Shift** before clicking
- Try releasing and re-pressing Shift
- Refresh the view (close and reopen)

### Right-Click Menu Not Showing Bulk Options

**Issue:** Right-click menu shows single-task options instead of bulk menu.

**Solution:**
- Verify multiple tasks are actually selected (visual feedback should be visible)
- Ensure you right-clicked on a **selected task** (not an unselected one)
- Try clearing selection (`Esc`) and re-selecting tasks

### Some Tasks Failing in Bulk Operation

**Issue:** Notification shows "X succeeded, Y failed".

**Solution:**
- Open Console (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I`) and check error messages
- Common fixes:
  - Ensure files are not read-only
  - Check file permissions
  - Verify tasks are not in a corrupted format
  - Reload the plugin (Settings → Community Plugins → Reload)
- Successfully updated tasks remain updated; manually fix failed tasks

### Bulk Delete Not Working

**Issue:** Confirmation modal appears, but tasks aren't deleted.

**Solution:**
- Check if files are locked or in use by another application
- Ensure Obsidian has write permissions
- Verify tasks are not in read-only files
- Check Console for error details

### Selection Deselecting Unexpectedly

**Issue:** Tasks deselect while trying to add more to selection.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're continuously holding Shift (not tapping it)
- Avoid clicking outside the task area
- Don't press Escape accidentally
- Disable any conflicting plugins or hotkeys
