The Notification Button provides at-a-glance awareness of pending and overdue tasks. Located in the toolbar, it displays a badge count and offers quick access to time-sensitive tasks that need your attention.

<VersionCallout version="9.9.0" />

## Overview

The Notification Button is a persistent global indicator that helps you stay on top of your task deadlines. It monitors all tasks across your vault and alerts you to:

- **Overdue tasks**: Tasks past their due date
- **Upcoming tasks**: Tasks due within the next week

**Key Features:**
- Global monitoring across all tasks (not workspace-specific)
- Real-time badge count updates
- Quick access dropdown menu
- Always visible in the toolbar

## Location

The Notification Button is located at the **far right of the toolbar** in the Task Genius main view.

It appears as a bell icon (<BellIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />) with a **red badge** in the top-right corner displaying the count of tasks requiring attention.

## Badge Count

### What the Badge Shows

The red badge displays the total number of **incomplete tasks** that are either:
1. Already overdue (past their due date)
2. Due within the next 7 days

**Example Counts:**
- Badge shows `5`: You have 5 incomplete tasks that are overdue or due within a week
- Badge shows `0` or is hidden: No urgent or upcoming tasks
- Badge updates **immediately** when you complete or modify tasks

### Real-Time Updates

The badge count is dynamic and updates automatically when:
- You complete a task (count decreases)
- You add a new task with an upcoming due date (count increases)
- A task becomes overdue as time passes (count increases)
- You change a task's due date (count may increase or decrease)

## Dropdown Menu

### Opening the Menu

Click the Notification Button (<BellIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" />) to open a dropdown menu showing all time-sensitive tasks.

### Menu Structure

The dropdown is organized into two sections:

#### 1. <AlertCircleIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> Overdue Tasks

Tasks that are **past their due date** and still incomplete.

- Sorted by how overdue they are (most overdue first)
- Displays task content, due date, and priority
- Visual indicator showing how many days overdue

**Example:**
```
Overdue Tasks (3)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
☐ Submit quarterly report
   Due: 3 days ago | Priority: High

☐ Review project proposal
   Due: 1 day ago | Priority: Medium

☐ Update documentation
   Due: Today | Priority: Low
```

#### 2. <ClockIcon className="inline-block w-5 h-5" /> Upcoming Tasks (Next 7 Days)

Tasks due within the **next week** (from today through 7 days from now).

- Sorted by due date (earliest first)
- Displays task content, due date, and priority
- Shows relative time (e.g., "Tomorrow", "In 3 days")

**Example:**
```
Upcoming (Next 7 Days) (4)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
☐ Team meeting preparation
   Due: Tomorrow | Priority: High

☐ Code review for PR #123
   Due: In 2 days | Priority: Medium

☐ Monthly planning session
   Due: In 5 days | Priority: Medium

☐ Backup project files
   Due: In 6 days | Priority: Low
```

### Menu Interactions

Within the dropdown menu, you can:

- **Click a task** to jump to its location in your vault
- **Check the checkbox** to mark a task as complete (removes it from the list)
- **Right-click a task** to open the context menu for additional actions
- **Scroll through the list** if you have many time-sensitive tasks

**Note:** The menu closes automatically when you click outside of it or when you select a task.

## Task Criteria

### What Tasks Appear

The Notification Button monitors tasks based on the following criteria:

**Included:**
- Tasks with a **Due Date** set
- Tasks that are **incomplete** (not marked as done)
- Tasks where the due date is:
  - In the past (overdue), OR
  - Within the next 7 days (upcoming)

**Excluded:**
- Completed tasks (marked as done with `x`)
- Tasks without a due date
- Tasks due more than 7 days in the future
- Tasks with only Scheduled or Start dates (no Due date)

### Time Window

The time window is **fixed** and cannot be customized:
- **Overdue**: From the beginning of time to yesterday
- **Upcoming**: From today to 7 days from now

**Timeline Example (Today is Jan 15):**
```
Jan 1  ─────────┬───────── Jan 14 ─┬─ Jan 15 ─┬───────── Jan 22 ─┬─────────> Future
                │                   │           │                  │
           [Overdue Tasks]    [Due Today]  [Upcoming Tasks]   [Not Shown]
                                                (Next 7 Days)
```

## Global Scope

The Notification Button operates **globally** across your entire vault:

- **Not workspace-specific**: Monitors all tasks regardless of the current [Workspace](/docs/workspace)
- **All views included**: Checks tasks from Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Flagged, and custom views
- **Vault-wide coverage**: Scans all files in your vault that contain tasks

**Implication**: Even if you switch workspaces or change views, the notification count remains consistent, reflecting all time-sensitive tasks in your vault.

## Use Cases

### Morning Review

Start your day by clicking the Notification Button to:
1. See what's overdue and needs immediate attention
2. Review what's coming up in the next week
3. Prioritize tasks based on urgency

### Quick Task Completion

Use the dropdown as a focused task list:
1. Complete overdue tasks directly from the menu
2. Clear your notification badge throughout the day
3. Maintain momentum by tackling time-sensitive items

### Deadline Awareness

Keep the badge count in your peripheral vision:
- Red badge with high count → Prioritize clearing overdue tasks
- Badge count decreasing → Progress feedback
- Badge at zero → All caught up on time-sensitive work

### Weekly Planning

At the start of the week:
1. Review the "Upcoming (Next 7 Days)" section
2. Identify tasks that need preparation or delegation
3. Adjust priorities or deadlines as needed

## Best Practices

### 1. Set Due Dates Intentionally

The Notification Button only tracks tasks with due dates:
- Use **Due Dates** for time-sensitive tasks with hard deadlines
- Use **Scheduled Dates** for planning without urgency
- Leave dates empty for backlog items

### 2. Aim for Zero Overdue

Make it a habit to clear overdue tasks:
- Review the "Overdue" section daily
- Complete, reschedule, or delegate overdue items
- Maintain a badge count focused on upcoming work

### 3. Use the 7-Day Window for Planning

The one-week window is designed for tactical planning:
- Check upcoming tasks at the start of each week
- Distribute work evenly across the next 7 days
- Adjust task scheduling if the upcoming list is overwhelming

### 4. Combine with Other Views

The Notification Button complements other features:
- Use **Calendar View** ([View Modes](/docs/view-modes)) for visual timeline planning
- Use **Today View** for daily focus
- Use **Notification Button** for urgent items across all contexts

### 5. Treat the Badge as a Signal

Let the badge count guide your workflow:
- **0-3**: Manageable, stay on track
- **4-10**: Moderate load, may need prioritization
- **10+**: High load, consider rescheduling or delegating

## Limitations

The Notification Button has the following limitations:

### 1. No Customization Options

- **Cannot disable**: The button is always visible in the toolbar
- **Cannot change time window**: Fixed at 7 days for upcoming tasks
- **Cannot add filters**: Shows all tasks meeting the criteria (cannot filter by priority, tag, etc.)

### 2. Due Date Dependency

- Only tracks tasks with **Due Dates** explicitly set
- Tasks with only Scheduled or Start dates are not included
- No fallback to other date fields

### 3. Global Scope Only

- Does not filter by current workspace
- Cannot scope to a specific project or tag
- Shows all qualifying tasks from the entire vault

### 4. No Notification System

- The button is a passive indicator, not an active notification system
- No alerts, sounds, or desktop notifications
- Requires manual checking by clicking the button

## Workarounds for Limitations

While the Notification Button cannot be customized, you can achieve similar functionality through other features:

### Custom Filtered Views

Create custom views ([Custom Views](/docs/task-view/custom-view)) with specific filters:
- **High Priority Overdue**: Filter by priority and overdue status
- **Work Tasks Due Soon**: Filter by tag/project and due date range
- **Personal Deadlines**: Filter by context or specific tags

### Combine with Workspace Strategy

Use [Workspaces](/docs/workspace) to mentally segment tasks:
- Check Notification Button for global awareness
- Switch to relevant workspace to focus on specific task sets
- Use workspace-specific views for detailed work

### Leverage View Modes

Use [View Modes](/docs/view-modes) for different perspectives:
- **Calendar View** to see the broader timeline (beyond 7 days)
- **Kanban View** to track task status and progress
- **List View** for comprehensive task details

## Troubleshooting

### Badge Count Seems Incorrect

**Issue**: The badge shows a different number than expected.

**Solution**:
- Verify task due dates (use List View to see all dates)
- Check if tasks are marked as complete
- Confirm tasks have **Due Dates** (not just Scheduled or Start dates)
- Refresh the Task Genius view (close and reopen)

### Tasks Not Appearing in Dropdown

**Issue**: Expected tasks are missing from the dropdown menu.

**Solution**:
- Ensure tasks have a Due Date field
- Verify tasks are incomplete (not marked with `x`)
- Check if the due date falls within the criteria:
  - Overdue: Past due date
  - Upcoming: Within next 7 days
- Tasks due 8+ days in the future will not appear

### Badge Not Updating After Task Completion

**Issue**: Completed a task but the badge count hasn't decreased.

**Solution**:
- Ensure the task was marked as complete (checkbox checked)
- Wait a moment for the UI to refresh
- Click the Notification Button to refresh the dropdown
- Restart Obsidian if the issue persists

### Dropdown Menu Empty Despite Badge Count

**Issue**: Badge shows a count, but the dropdown is empty.

**Solution**:
- Check the console for errors (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I)
- Verify Task Genius has properly indexed your vault
- Try reloading the plugin (Settings → Community Plugins → Reload)
- Check for file permission issues
