import { VersionCallout } from "@/components/VersionCallout";

Quick Capture lets you instantly record tasks and notes without interrupting your workflow. Whether you're in the middle of editing a document or need to jot down a quick idea, Task Genius provides multiple capture methods optimized for different scenarios.

<VersionCallout version="6.0.0" />

## Overview

Task Genius offers three capture interfaces, each designed for specific use cases:

1. **Editor Quick Capture**: Inline panel within your current editor (like Org-mode's `M-x org-capture`)
2. **Minimal Quick Capture**: Simple modal for fast task entry with due date
3. **Detailed Capture**: Comprehensive modal with full metadata support and multi-line input

<VersionCallout version="9.9.0" />

Starting with version 9.9.0, Quick Capture supports both:
- **Checkbox Tasks**: Traditional task items (`- [ ] Task`)
- **File-Level Tasks**: Entire notes as tasks (requires [File Indexer](#file-level-task-capture))

## Capture Methods

### 1. Editor Quick Capture (Inline Panel)

A lightweight input panel that appears at the bottom of your current editor, inspired by Org-mode's capture workflow.

**How to Use:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Best For:**
- Complex tasks requiring multiple metadata fields
- Batch task entry (multiple tasks at once)
- Project-based task creation
- Tasks with detailed context

**Features:**

#### Multi-Line Input
Capture multiple tasks in one session:
```markdown
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

All tasks inherit the metadata you configure.

#### Relative Date Support
Use natural language for due dates:
- `明天` (tomorrow)
- `后天` (day after tomorrow)
- `大后天` (three days from now)
- `下周一` (next Monday)
- (Supports your system's date parsing)

#### Live Preview
See exactly what will be written to your file before capturing.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `Write report`
- **Metadata:** Due: 2025-01-20, Priority: High, Tags: #work
- **Preview:** `- [ ] Write report 📅 2025-01-20 🔺 #work`

#### Supported Metadata
Configure any task metadata:
- **Due Date**: Task deadline
- **Start Date**: When to begin
- **Scheduled Date**: Planned work date
- **Priority**: Urgency level (1-5)
- **Status**: Task state (not started, in progress, etc.)
- **Tags**: Categorization tags
- **Project**: Project assignment
- **Context**: Work context (e.g., @home, @office)
- (All standard task metadata fields)

## File-Level Task Capture

<VersionCallout version="9.9.0" />

Create entire notes as tasks instead of checkbox items.

### Requirements

**File Indexer must be enabled:**
1. Open Task Genius settings
2. Go to **Indexer** settings
3. Enable **"File-level task indexing"** or similar option

Once enabled, the capture modals (Minimal and Detailed) display a **tab switcher** at the top.

### Tab Switcher

**Tabs:**
- **Checkbox Task**: Traditional task items (default)
- **File Task**: Entire notes as tasks

**Behavior:**
- Switch tabs to change capture mode
- Settings persist between sessions
- Tab only appears if File Indexer is enabled

### File Task Mode

When capturing a **File Task**:

1. **Template Integration**:
   - Task Genius calls your configured template (if any)
   - Template content is used as the base for the new file
   - File name is generated based on your input

2. **Metadata as Frontmatter**:
   - All metadata from the metadata panel is inserted as **YAML Frontmatter**
   - No inline fields are used

3. **File Creation**:
   - New file is created in the configured target location
   - File name is derived from your task title or template settings

**Example Workflow:**

**Input:**
- **Mode:** File Task
- **Title:** `Website Redesign Project`
- **Metadata:**
  - Due: 2025-02-15
  - Priority: High
  - Tags: work, design
  - Project: Q1 Goals

**Result:**

File created: `Website Redesign Project.md`
```yaml
---
due: 2025-02-15
priority: high
tags:
  - work
  - design
project: Q1 Goals
---

# Website Redesign Project

(Template content if configured)
```

**Best For:**
- Project planning notes
- Large tasks requiring dedicated documentation
- Integration with project management workflows
- Notes that need extensive details

## Configuration

<DeepLinkButton href="obsidian://task-genius/settings?tab=quick-capture">
  Open Quick Capture Settings
</DeepLinkButton>
<DeepLinkFallback />

### Target File

Specify where captured tasks will be saved.

**Setting:** "Target File"

**Format:** File path (e.g., `Inbox.md`, `Daily/Capture.md`)

**Examples:**
```
Inbox.md
Quick Notes.md
Tasks/Capture.md
```

**File Auto-Creation:**
- If the file doesn't exist, Task Genius automatically creates it
- Parent directories are created if needed

---

### Dynamic Date Variables

<VersionCallout version="9.9.0" />

Use date variables in the target file path for dynamic daily capture.

**Syntax:** `{{DATE:FORMAT}}`

**Supported Formats:** Any valid date format string (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `YYYYMMDD`)

**Examples:**

**Daily Note Capture:**
```
Target File: Daily Notes/{{DATE:YYYY-MM-DD}}.md
Result (on 2025-01-15): Daily Notes/2025-01-15.md
```

**Monthly Capture:**
```
Target File: Capture/{{DATE:YYYY-MM}}/Tasks.md
Result (on 2025-01-15): Capture/2025-01/Tasks.md
```

**Weekly Capture:**
```
Target File: Weekly/{{DATE:YYYY-[W]WW}}.md
Result (on 2025-01-15): Weekly/2025-W03.md
```

**Benefit:** Automatically capture to today's note without manual file selection.

---

### Insert Position

Choose where in the target file captured items are added.

**Setting:** "Insert Position"

**Options:**

#### Append (Default)
Add captured tasks to the **end** of the file.

**Use Case:** Chronological task capture (newest at bottom)

**Example:**
```markdown
# Inbox

- [x] Old task 1
- [x] Old task 2
- [ ] New captured task  ← Added here
```

---

#### Prepend
Add captured tasks to the **beginning** of the file.

**Use Case:** Newest tasks first (priority-based)

**Example:**
```markdown
# Inbox

- [ ] New captured task  ← Added here
- [x] Old task 1
- [x] Old task 2
```

---

#### Replace
**Advanced Option** (use with caution)

Replace the entire file content with captured tasks.

**Use Case:** Temporary scratchpad or single-task files

**Warning:** All existing content is overwritten. Use only if intentional.

---

### Task Formatting

<VersionCallout version="9.9.0" />

**Current Behavior:**
- Checkbox tasks are automatically prefixed with `- [ ]` (if not already present)
- Metadata is added as inline fields (for checkbox tasks) or frontmatter (for file tasks)
- No additional template variables or formatting options (planned for future versions)

**For Advanced Formatting:**
- Consider using File Task mode with templates
- Manually edit captured tasks after creation
- Use [Workflows](/docs/workflows) for post-capture automation

## Use Cases & Workflows

   - Priority: High
   - Tags: marketing, q1
5. Click "Capture"

**Result:**
New file created: `Projects/Q1 Marketing Campaign.md` with frontmatter containing all metadata.

**Benefit:** Structured project initialization with metadata-driven workflows.

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Capture Method for the Situation

**Quick Decision Guide:**
- **Editing a document?** → Editor Quick Capture (`Alt+C`)
- **Need to set a due date?** → Minimal Quick Capture
- **Complex task with metadata?** → Detailed Capture
- **Creating a project note?** → Detailed Capture (File Task mode)

---

### 2. Process Your Inbox Regularly

Don't let captured tasks pile up:
- Set a daily or weekly inbox review time
- Use [Task View](/docs/task-view) to see all inbox tasks
- Use [Bulk Operations](/docs/bulk-operations) to assign metadata efficiently

---

### 3. Use Dynamic Date Variables for Daily Notes

If you use daily notes, always configure:
```
Target File: Daily Notes/{{DATE:YYYY-MM-DD}}.md
```

This ensures tasks are captured to the correct day automatically.

---

### 4. Leverage Detailed Capture for Batch Entry

Instead of capturing one task at a time:
- Open Detailed Capture once
- Enter 5-10 tasks in the input area
- Set shared metadata (project, priority)
- Capture all at once

**Saves time** compared to individual captures.

---

### 5. Combine with Keyboard Shortcuts

**Recommended Hotkeys:**
- `Alt+C`: Editor Quick Capture (default)
- `Ctrl+Shift+C`: Minimal Quick Capture
- `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C`: Detailed Capture

**Tip:** Assign hotkeys in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings for muscle-memory efficiency.

---

### 6. Use File Tasks for Large Initiatives

For tasks that need extensive documentation:
- Use **File Task** mode instead of checkbox tasks
- Create dedicated files for projects, goals, or complex tasks
- Benefit from templates and structured metadata

## Limitations

### No External Triggering

Quick Capture requires Obsidian to be open and focused. It cannot be triggered from outside Obsidian (e.g., global system hotkey).

**Workaround:**
- Use Obsidian's URI protocol with automation tools (e.g., AutoHotkey, Keyboard Maestro)
- Consider third-party integrations (check community resources)

---

### Limited Template Support (Checkbox Tasks)

Template variables (e.g., `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{content}}`) are not currently supported for checkbox task capture.

**Workaround:**
- Use **File Task** mode for template-based capture
- Manually edit tasks after capture
- Use [Workflows](/docs/workflows) for post-capture formatting

---

### Single Target File

Each capture method uses one configured target file (though it supports date variables).

**Workaround:**
- Use different capture methods for different targets
- Manually change target file in settings when needed
- Use **Project** metadata to organize tasks within a single capture file

---

### No Multi-File Capture

Cannot capture to multiple files simultaneously.

**Workaround:**
- Capture to inbox, then use [Task Mover](/docs/task-mover) to distribute tasks
- Use [Bulk Operations](/docs/bulk-operations) to move tasks to different project files

## Troubleshooting

### Capture Panel Not Appearing

**Issue:** Pressing `Alt+C` does nothing.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're focused on an **editor pane** (not settings, graph, or other views)
- Check if the hotkey is conflicting with another plugin (Obsidian Settings → Hotkeys)
- Try triggering via command palette: `Ctrl/Cmd+P` → `Task Genius: Toggle quick capture panel`

---

### Tasks Not Saving to Target File

**Issue:** Captured tasks disappear or don't appear in the target file.

**Solution:**
- Verify the target file path in settings (Settings → Quick Capture → Target File)
- Check if the file exists or if auto-creation is working
- Ensure you have write permissions to the target directory
- Check the console for errors (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I`)

---

### Date Variables Not Working

**Issue:** `{{DATE:YYYY-MM-DD}}` appears literally instead of being replaced.

**Solution:**
- Verify the syntax is exact: `{{DATE:FORMAT}}` (case-sensitive)
- Ensure you're using a valid date format string
- Restart Obsidian to reload settings
- Check Task Genius version (date variables require 9.9.0+)

---

### File Task Tab Not Showing

**Issue:** The "File Task" tab doesn't appear in capture modals.

**Solution:**
- Verify **File Indexer** is enabled in Task Genius settings
- Check Settings → Indexer → Enable file-level task indexing
- Restart Obsidian after enabling
- Ensure you're using Task Genius 9.9.0 or later

---

### Metadata Not Applying

**Issue:** Metadata from Detailed Capture isn't added to tasks.

**Solution:**
- **Checkbox Tasks:** Metadata should appear as inline fields (e.g., `[due:: 2025-01-20]`)
- **File Tasks:** Metadata should be in YAML frontmatter
- Check the preview pane before capturing to verify formatting
- Ensure metadata fields are filled correctly (no invalid values)

---

### Preview Showing Wrong Format

**Issue:** Preview doesn't match what actually gets captured.

**Solution:**
- This may indicate a bug—report to the developer
- Double-check your settings (Insert Position, Target File)
- Try capturing a test task to a scratch file
